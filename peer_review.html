            <p class="ques"><b>Question-2</b></p>
            <p>The written script is capable of accepting input from the command line. If no arguments have been given, it reports an error and exits the program. If not, then he initialized a counter and take a run a while loop till is less than equal to 10 and displays the fetched result by multiplying and updating the counter in every iteration.</p>
        
            <p class="ques"><b>Question-3</b></p>
            <p>He created the prime function, which checks if an integer is prime or not. He flags the number as not being a prime if it is less than 2, and if it is, he runs a loop from 2 to sqrt(n) to see whether any of the other numbers divide the supplied number (inclusive of both). If any numbers were found he incremented the counter which resembles no of factors for the given number, and if the no of factors is greater than or equal to 1 which means we can assume that they are not prime because they have a divisor other than themselves and 1, which means they are not prime. Else if it is 0 they are prime as they have zero divisors.

                User input is taken in and saved in a variable in the main program code before the function is run and the argument is supplied as command line parameters.

        <P>He had used the cat command to copy the text as it reads the content from the file and he passed it to append it to the required file, he hasn't created that explicitly but the absence of file while executing the command itself creates the file and performs the said operation.
        </P>

        <p class="ques"><b>Question-5</b></p>
        <p>He utilized a for loop to obtain the highest and lowest element. Using the initial element in the loop as the maximum, he toured each element in the loop to check if it was bigger than the maximum value that had, presumably, been determined. If it was, he set it to the current element; otherwise, he continued traversing. He used the same procedure to determine the minimum.
